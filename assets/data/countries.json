    "description": " Antonie Van Leeuwenhoek was born in 1632 in Delft, Dutch Republic. Talking about his education, Leeuwenhoek never attended any university. He was unaware of other scientific research and rather re-investigated already existing phenomena. He has contributed extensively in the field of microscopy. He designed hand-made microscopes that he used to observe samples like dental plaques and water. Additionally, he was the first to give microscopic observations of organisms and/or cells like bacteria, RBCs, spermatozoa etc. He was also among the first to witness blood flow among capillaries.  He is also credited as being the first person to observe and document the existence of microorganisms. Leeuwenhoek had techniques for lens grinding and microscope construction that were significantly essential for advancing microscopy.Alongside this, his groundbreaking discoveries about the microscope expanded our understanding about microscopes and led to working for better designs."

He did his studies at the University of Copenhagen. He was assigned as botany assistant to the zoologist Japetus Steenstrup. Because of his study about plants, he learned the basics of pharmacology and the use of the microscope. His main field of career was bacteriology. In 1878, Gram started his medical school and completed his graduation in 1883.In Berlin, Gram developed a method for distinguishing between two major bacterial classes in 1884. This technique is called Gram staining, which divides bacteria into gram positive and gram negative on the basis of capacity to take up stains, which is still a standard technique of medical microbiology. Because of his work he achieved an international reputation. The staining method later played a major role in classifying bacteria. Gram was a modest man, and in his initial publication he remarked, 'I have therefore published the method, although I am aware that as yet it is very defective and imperfect; but it is hoped that also in the hands of other investigators it will turn out to be useful. Gram staining uses a primary stain that is of crystal violet and a counterstain of safranin. Bacteria that turn purple when stained are known as 'Gram-positive', while those that turn red are termed 'Gram-negative'. His  initial work was about the study of human red blood cells. He was one of the first who recognised that macrocytes were characteristic of pernicious anemia. During 1891, Gram taught pharmacology, and he was appointed as professor at the University of Copenhagen. In 1900, he left his professorship of pharmacology and became professor of medicine.As a professor, he published four volumes of clinical lectures. He retired from the University of Copenhagen in 1923. "

She studied French and home economics at finishing school in switzerland.In 1872, while traveling in Germany with Eugenie, she met Eugenie's brother, her future husband and research partner, Walther Hess. The couple became engaged in 1873, and they married in 1874 with a wedding held in Geneva finally becoming fanny hess. In addition to her housekeeping duties, Hesse gives her best to assist her husband through preparing bacterial growth media, cleaning equipment, and producing illustrations for scientific publications. After  becoming familiar with her husband's work she performed a role similar to a modern-day medical technologist, She also performed a role as a scientific illustrator, drawing highly accurate watercolor images showing each growth phase of intestinal bacterial culture when viewed under magnification, and her illustrations were included in her husband's work that was published in 1908 as part of her work in the development of medical illustration. Hess helped to coat test tubes with gelatin for her husband to use in growing microorganisms but they discovered that gelatin easily melted on warm days, destroying some of the bacteria. With her technical duties, she also helped through her artistic abilities to draw the same pictures of bacterial colonies as viewed under a microscope in the different phases of bacteria growth to use in her husband's journal publications. She recommended agar as a plating medium and she was also helping her husband to culture air-borne bacteria. In 1881, while her husband was working in the laboratory of  Robert Koch who was a German physician and microbiologist, they  had tried to use potato slices as a medium to culture pure colonies but it was unsubstantial, they tried  to use a nutrient-rich gelatin media, which still did not provide adequate stability for producing cultures for examination. After so many unsuccessful attempts of culturing microorganisms on gelatin mediums, Hesse suggested that agar was preferable to gelatin for cultivating bacteria and other microorganisms. She was knowing about the properties of agar as a gelling agent, able to maintain its physical properties at warm temperatures, through her usage of it at home. She had learned about agar from her mother’s friend. She was first to suggest using agar as an alternative to gelatin; they were first to use agar as a common gelling agent for producing media capable of culturing microorganisms at high temperatures. The main difference between agar and gelatin was agar could remain solid at temperatures up to 90°C while settling at temperatures below 45°C, gelatin liquified at 37°C, which made it an unsuitable medium to plate many types of bacteria in laboratory conditions. The agar 'dessert medium' invented by Hesse. "

Earlier he studied plant galls, swellings of plant tissue now known to be caused by the invasion of various infectious agents. He isolated bacillus radicicola, the nodule organism of leguminous plants in 1888. His studies are essential for soil science, azotobacter, sulfur bacteria and on denitrification (which convert soil nitrates to free atmospheric nitrogen). He was the first who said that viruses are reproducing entities, but it is different from other living organisms. He also visited the laboratory of German bacteriologist Robert Koch to learn. His works and scientific reputation were expanding and  in 1895 the Dutch government created a special position for him at the delft polytechnical school. He remained there till his retirement in 1921."

Alongside this, he also discovered the route of their transmission. He studied illness caused by microorganisms, discovered and described   TB bacterium in 1882. In 1883 he discovered an organism which causes cholera and worked on how it is transmitted and also developed a vaccination for rinderpest. His main works Known are Koch's postulates, Koch–Pasteur rivalry ,Bacterial culture method, Germ theory of disease, Medical microbiology ,Discovery of anthrax bacillus ,Discovery of tuberculosis bacillus and tuberculin for which he won nobel prize. Koch was made a Knight Grand Cross in the Prussian Order of the Red Eagle,  on 19 November 1890, It was awarded to both military personnel and civilians, to recognize valor in combat, excellence in military leadership, long and faithful service to the kingdom and elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1897.  He won The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1905 for his investigations and discoveries in relation to tuberculosis (TB). In order to honor Robot Koch, In 1906, because of his research on tuberculosis and tropical diseases, he was honored by the Order Pour le Merite. The Robert Koch Foundation, founded in 1907, is a not for profit foundation for the promotion of medical progress in Berlin. The Foundation has the goal of supporting the fight against infectious diseases and other epidemics This Foundation awards each year a number of prestigious scientific awards: the Robert Koch Award, one of the highest-ranking scientific awards in Germany, the Robert Koch Gold Medal in 1980. The Robert Koch Award is one of the most esteemed scientific awards in the Federal Republic of Germany. The prize is awarded annually to researchers for outstanding and internationally recognized scientific achievements.

After that, he studied at fitzwilliam college, cambridge as PhD student and there he started working on phospholipids under the guidance of sir frederick gowland hopkins. In 1935, he became lecturer of pathology at oxford university. During this period he worked on many topics including tumor metabolism, lysozymes, snake venoms and biochemistry techniques. In 1939, he investigated natural antibacterial agents which was synthesized by microorganisms with Howard florey. Chain and florey together worked on therapeutic action and its chemical composition. They discovered techniques to isolate and concentrate the germ killing agents in penicillin. For this work, both chain and florey won the nobel prize in physiology or medicine. Chain was also working on theorizing the beta-lactam structure of penicillin in 1942, which was later confirmed by Dorothy hodgkin through x- ray crystallography. Towards the end of world war II, he got to know that his mother and sister had been killed by nazis. He returned to Britain in 1964 and became founder and head of the biochemistry department at Imperial college, london. He stayed there till his retirement and also did specialization in fermentation technologies. "

    "description": "Yuan Longping, internationally known as the ‘father of hybrid rice was a Chinese plant scientist whose breakthroughs in developing high-yield hybrid strains of rice helped to alleviate famine and poverty across much of Asia and Africa. Yuan Longping was born in Beijing in 1930 and received his agronomic degree from Southwest Agricultural College (now Southwest University) in 1953. Subsequently, he began his teaching career at Anjiang Agricultural School in Hunan Province, China.  Mr. Yuan’s work on hybrid rice started in the 1960 with the backdrop of an unprecedented famine. He reported findings on mutated male-sterile rice plants in the Chinese Science Bulletin in 1966. As these experiments did not show significant advantage over common rice, he started cross breeding with a wild rice species, known as ‘wild abortive’.Subsequent experiments, involving a large team of scientists and farmers across the country, proved successful as the new hybrid rice performed better than conventional rice. By 1979, this technique for hybrid rice was being introduced in the United States. Mr. Yuan’s rice accomplishments continued over the years.The late 1990s saw the launch of the Super Hybrid Rice Breeding Research Programme, under Mr. Yuan’s guidance, aiming to carry out national demonstration and promotion of the research results of super rice. In the next decade, China doubled rice production while reducing use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides.Yuan Longping’s hybrid rice varieties eventually became dominant in China’s paddies and in overall rice production. And China has dominated world hybrid rice production since 2004.Mr Yuan Longping was credited with a long list of awards and prizes, including China’s first special invention award in 1981, the UNESCO Prize for Science in 1987, the Nikkei Asia Award in 1996, the State Preeminent Science and Technology Award in 2000, the Wolf Prize in Agriculture and the Word Food Prize in 2004.Mr Yuan Longping passed away on 22 May 2021 at the age of 91, in Changsha, Hunan Province, China."

He retired from this institute in 1999 at the age of 65. Potrykus and his research team gave attention to genetic engineering yield stability and food quality of crops such as rice, wheat, millet, sorghum and cassava, because of the announcement of the upcoming crisis issue of malnutrition in developing countries. Golden rice is one of the most significant creations done till now. He took funding from the Rockefeller Foundation and combined with Peter Beyer and together launched a project to develop Golden Rice, that would become a seven-year, $2.6 million. He retired in 1999 and Ingo Potrykus became president of the International Humanitarian Golden Rice Board and devoted his energy to guiding Golden Rice to farmers across the many problems of a GMO-crop.

Since he was born to a gardener's family, so he had limited resources, therefore he was raised in a rural setting but his academic abilities were recognised by the local priest and this made his parents to send him away to the school at an age of 11. Then he completed his 2 year program in philosophy at Philosophical institute of University of Olmutz and excelled in the field of physics and mathematics thereby completing his studies in 1843. He then moved on to the monastery to Brunn, capital of Moravia where he was freed from all the harsh struggle of life that he did in the previous years. At University of Vienna he devoted time to mathematics and physics along with which he studied anatomy and philosophy of plants and learnt how to use the microscope in the summer of 1853. In 1854 Mendel planned a major experiment on hybridization at his own ministry whose major aim was to know about the hybridization and transmission of characters in the following generations and choiced Pisum sativum that is edible pea plant mainly to conduct his studies upon, because of numerous distinct varieties, ease of culture and control of pollination with high proportion of the excessive germinations. With time as genetic studies were pushed down at molecular level, Mendelian's gene theory became acceptable and started being acknowledged as Father of Genetics"

Then she moved on to Paris in 1947 as postdoctoral researcher and became a successful X-ray crystallographer. Though she was able to unearth some of the major properties of DNA which gradually helped to discover the correct description of the double helix structure of DNA, her work was unrecognized in her lifetime due to which she was given various names as 'wronged heroin', 'dark lady of DNA', 'forgotten heroin', 'feminist icon' and so on. In April 2023, based on the new evidence, scientists concluded that Franklin was a contributor and 'equal player' in the discovery process of DNA. Her work was mainly based on the understanding and discovery of concepts related to the molecular structures of DNA, RNA, viruses, coal and graphite and due to her hard work and devotion she got appreciation for the coal and viruses in her lifetime. Franklin's various contributions in the field of science includes the following: \n 1.She performed X-ray diffraction studies that provided some important clues regarding the structure of DNA.\n 2.She also explained the effect of heating and carbonisation on the permeability of coal and carbon in which she found that the pores at molecular level have 5 constrictions which increase with the heating and they are known as 'molecular sieves'. Since she was the first one to identify these microstructures, so it became possible to classify coal and predict their performances with high degree of accuracy.\n 3. She also introduced the words like graphitizing and non-graphitizing carbon which formed the basis for the development of carbon fibers and new heat resistant materials and it made her earn an International reputation among the coal chemists.\n 4. She also analyzed the different patterns that revealed that tobacco mosaic virus's genetic material ieRNA was embedded in the protective protein shell's inner wall.\n 5. Therefore, in her 16 year career, Franklin published 19 articles on coals and carbon, 5 on DNA and 21 on viruses. Even in her last few years she received the maximum number of invitations to speak at various conferences all over the world which was mainly due to her research work on viruses and that had earned tremendous awards and professional recognition. Her prominent publications include thermal 'expansion of coals and carbonized coals', 'study of 5 structure of carbonaceous solids by measurements of true and apparent densities: part one - coals', 'study of 5 structure of carbonaceous solids by measurements of true and apparent densities: part two - carbonized coals', 'the structure of graphitic carbons' and many more."

    "description": "Daisy Roulland-Dussoix (9 September 1936 at  Geneva, Switzerland – 5 January 2014 at  Lancy, Switzerland) was a Swiss molecular microbiologist. During her undergraduate education, she worked as a researcher on restriction enzymes. Daisy Roulland-Dussoix was born on September 9, 1936 in Geneva, Switzerland. His parents were Edmond Louis Dusoit and Elsa Magatha (Sauerbrey) Dusoit. Daisy Roulland-Dussoix (née Daisy Dussoix) received her first degree in chemistry and biology at the University of Geneva (1958), followed by her doctorate in biophysics (1964). While a graduate student at the University of Geneva, she discovered restriction enzymes, bacterial enzymes that attach to DNA. This discovery led to the advancement of molecular biology, opening the door to genome editing and cloning technology. His lawyer, Werner Arber, won the Nobel Prize in 1978 for this discovery. Later in her career, Daisy transferred to UCSF, where she worked on proto-oncogenes with Harold Varmus, who won the Nobel Prize in 1989. In 1980 Daisy moved to Paris and became director of the Mycoplasma Laboratory at the Pasteur Institute. She failed in January 2014. While working on his PhD with Swiss microbial geneticists Werner Arber and Eduard Kellenberger, he first demonstrated that immunity from bacteria (bacteriophages) led to the discovery that restriction and treatment of enzymes were important. Molecular Biology Tools. These enzymes affect the cleavage of DNA from specific sequences by enzymes at specific points, unless the enzymes are protected by enzymatic modification through the DNA base. This system prevents the spread of bacterial infections. Grete Kellenberger-Gujer's previous research showed that phage DNA can be degraded by the host's bacterial cells. Daisy Dussoix and Werner Arber showed in two publications that this process requires enzymes, paving the way for the discovery and isolation of relevant restriction and repair enzymes. They first presented these results at the First International Congress on Biophysics in Stockholm in 1961. In 1964, supported by a postdoctoral fellowship from Jane Pall Childs, Dussoit moved to Stanford University in the United States to work with Robert Lehman. From 1968 he was an assistant professor in the Department of Microbiology at the University of California, San Francisco, where he continued to work on DNA restriction and repair with Herbert W Boyer."
