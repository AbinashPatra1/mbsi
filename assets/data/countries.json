    "description": " Antonie Van Leeuwenhoek was born in 1632 in Delft, Dutch Republic. Talking about his education, Leeuwenhoek never attended any university. He was unaware of other scientific research and rather re-investigated already existing phenomena. He has contributed extensively in the field of microscopy. He designed hand-made microscopes that he used to observe samples like dental plaques and water. Additionally, he was the first to give microscopic observations of organisms and/or cells like bacteria, RBCs, spermatozoa etc. He was also among the first to witness blood flow among capillaries.  He is also credited as being the first person to observe and document the existence of microorganisms. Leeuwenhoek had techniques for lens grinding and microscope construction that were significantly essential for advancing microscopy.Alongside this, his groundbreaking discoveries about the microscope expanded our understanding about microscopes and led to working for better designs."

    "description": "Ignaz Philipp Semmelweis was born on July 1 at  Tabán, Budapest, Hungary, 1818. He was a scientist of Hungarian and German descent, an early pioneer of sterilization, and was called the 'Savior of the Mother'. Postpartum disease, also known as puerperal fever or puerperal fever and caused by bacteria present in the body after birth, emerged in the 19th century and often causes death. Semmelweis found that infection could be reduced by health care workers washing their hands during maternity meetings. In 1847, he recommended washing hands with chlorinated lime, which caused the death of the hospital quack at the First Obstetrics Clinic of the Vienna General Hospital at the midwife hospital. On 1 July 1846, Semmelweis was appointed assistant to Johann Klein at the First Obstetrics Clinic of the Vienna General Hospital. A similar position in U.S. nursing homes would be “primary residents.” His job is to check the patient's medication status every morning. Tour the church, monitor the quality of birth, educate doctors, and act as the 'author' of documents. Semmelweis was concerned that the death rate from puerperal fever was higher in his first hospital than in his second hospital. This makes me sad and life is empty. The two meetings were used in almost the same way, and Semmelweis set out to judge all the differences. 'Overcrowding' is prohibited because deaths are fewer, although other hospitals are always overcrowded. Since both meetings were close to the region, the decision was made based on the weather. She also changed her main job to giving birth and asked an employee to perform the hospital's final rite, which would scare women and cause them to become feverish after giving birth. Semmelweis's idea was confirmed in 1847 when his close friend Jakob Kolletschka died in an accident. Use a student scalpel during autopsy to perform an autopsy. Kolecka's autopsy revealed lesions similar to those seen in women who died of puerperal fever. Semmelweis could not help suggesting a connection between poor hygiene and puerperal fever. He pointed out that from the hospital room to the first obstetrics hospital, he and the medical researchers carried 'cadaver patches' in their hands during the examination. This explains why the student midwife at the reserve hospital was not working. Mortality was lower in postmortem and unexposed subjects. The alleged origin of the complaint has not been verified in Vienna. Therefore, Semmelweis concluded that some unknown 'physical substance' caused postpartum diarrhea. He introduced the rule of using chlorinated lime (calcium hypochlorite) for hand washing during physical and medical examinations. He did this because he found that these chlorination products were effective in removing foul odors from infected tissue, thereby reducing the potential for disease-causing bacteria to 'poison' or 'cadaver' workers suspected of being infected with this equipment. The result was a reduction of 90 deaths at the primary hospital and a similar death rate at the backup hospital. The death rate in April 1847 was 18.3. After hand washing was introduced in mid-May, the death rate was 2.2 in June, 1.2 in July and 1.9 in August, while the number of deaths was zero in the next two periods for the first time since the disease first appeared in the body. . months. Semmelweis is now known as the colonizer of the antimicrobial law. In 2008, Semmelweis was awarded the Austrian coin 'Ignak Semmelweis Prize', Hungary's most prestigious medical award. Semmelweis thought there was a connection between the dead. It has been speculated that some of the 'death stains' on the tissues of the corpse were left at the hands of yellow charlatans and medical scientists during pregnancy; diseases are carried and patches are changed for women in need. He is also known as the 'Father of Disease Prevention' and the 'Savior of Mankind'. He was the first in medical history to demonstrate to doctors that puerperal fever (also known as 'puerperal fever') was contagious and that its spread could be greatly reduced by proper hand washing. He died on August 13, 1865 at Oberdöbling, Vienna, Austria"

She studied French and home economics at finishing school in switzerland.In 1872, while traveling in Germany with Eugenie, she met Eugenie's brother, her future husband and research partner, Walther Hess. The couple became engaged in 1873, and they married in 1874 with a wedding held in Geneva finally becoming fanny hess. In addition to her housekeeping duties, Hesse gives her best to assist her husband through preparing bacterial growth media, cleaning equipment, and producing illustrations for scientific publications. After  becoming familiar with her husband's work she performed a role similar to a modern-day medical technologist, She also performed a role as a scientific illustrator, drawing highly accurate watercolor images showing each growth phase of intestinal bacterial culture when viewed under magnification, and her illustrations were included in her husband's work that was published in 1908 as part of her work in the development of medical illustration. Hess helped to coat test tubes with gelatin for her husband to use in growing microorganisms but they discovered that gelatin easily melted on warm days, destroying some of the bacteria. With her technical duties, she also helped through her artistic abilities to draw the same pictures of bacterial colonies as viewed under a microscope in the different phases of bacteria growth to use in her husband's journal publications. She recommended agar as a plating medium and she was also helping her husband to culture air-borne bacteria. In 1881, while her husband was working in the laboratory of  Robert Koch who was a German physician and microbiologist, they  had tried to use potato slices as a medium to culture pure colonies but it was unsubstantial, they tried  to use a nutrient-rich gelatin media, which still did not provide adequate stability for producing cultures for examination. After so many unsuccessful attempts of culturing microorganisms on gelatin mediums, Hesse suggested that agar was preferable to gelatin for cultivating bacteria and other microorganisms. She was knowing about the properties of agar as a gelling agent, able to maintain its physical properties at warm temperatures, through her usage of it at home. She had learned about agar from her mother’s friend. She was first to suggest using agar as an alternative to gelatin; they were first to use agar as a common gelling agent for producing media capable of culturing microorganisms at high temperatures. The main difference between agar and gelatin was agar could remain solid at temperatures up to 90°C while settling at temperatures below 45°C, gelatin liquified at 37°C, which made it an unsuitable medium to plate many types of bacteria in laboratory conditions. The agar 'dessert medium' invented by Hesse. "

He was soon captivated by research, however, and chose to major in chemistry and biology. He completed a PhD in biochemistry at the University of Pittsburgh and then went on to a postdoctoral fellowship at Yale University. In 1966 he accepted an appointment at UCSF, which was becoming a center of excellence in the several disciplines that contributed to the emerging field of biotechnology.The first success of the Boyer-Cohen collaboration occurred in spring 1973 and involved one of Cohen’s plasmids, pSC101. Plasmids were already known to transfer drug resistance among bacteria, and this one could make E. coli resistant to the antibiotic tetracycline. The plasmid pSC101 was cleaved by EcoRI at only one site, leaving intact the plasmid’s ability to replicate. When the linearized pSC101 DNA was mixed with other DNA that had been cleaved by the same enzyme, the complementary ends of fragments from both sources of DNA joined together into new loops. Treatment with another enzyme closed the still-visible nicks in the DNA loops, which were then introduced into calcium chloride–treated bacteria. The bacteria were spread on a culture containing tetracycline, and only the bacteria with the rDNA plasmids survived.Boyer and Cohen soon moved on to more complicated cloning experiments. They joined tetracycline-resistant plasmids with kanamycin-resistant plasmids—kanamycin being another antibiotic—and inserted them in E. coli. Next they showed that genetic materials could indeed be transferred between species, thereby disproving a long-held myth. They snipped a piece of Staphylococcus plasmid (Staphylococcus is the bacteria responsible for staph infections), spliced it with one of the many E. coli plasmids, and inserted the whole in E. coli. The DNA from Staphylococcus, a different species of bacteria, was successfully propagated in E. coli. An even greater triumph of interspecies cloning was the insertion into E. coli of genes taken from the South African clawed frog.Boyer received the Biotechnology Heritage Award in 2000 from  the Science History Institute, and the Biotechnology Innovation Organization.Cohen was honored with the 2016 Biotechnology Heritage Award in recognition of his revolutionary work in creating rDNA plasmids, a foundation of all biotechnology .Boyer also received the Society of Chemical Industry’s Perkin Medal in 2007 and the Winthrop-Sears Medal in 2005."

On 19th September 1946, Ereky was sent to the prison of Vác for 12 years by the People's Tribunal for his counter-revolutionary role in Hungary. He died in prison on 17 June 1952 at the age of 74. He received a degree in technical engineering at Technical University of Budapest in 1900. until 1905, he worked as a machine designer for several companies in the paper and food industry in Vienna, Austria. After that, he became an assistant professor in József Technical University.In 1919 he became the Hungarian food Minister.  Ereky was also good at speaking both German and English. Hundreds of his written publications were written in Hungarian and published in German. In 1922, he wrote a book on the chlorophyll mechanism and how it can be used for animal feeding. In 1925, he wrote a book on leaf proteins as a possible food source which he also promoted as a commercial product. In 1919, in a book he published in Berlin called Biotechnologie der Fleisch-, Fett- und Milcherzeugung im landwirtschaftlichen Grossbetriebe (Biotechnology of Meat, Fat and Milk Production in an Agricultural Large-Scale Farm), here first he coined the term “biotechnology” where he explained  a technology based on converting raw materials into a more useful product. He built a slaughterhouse for a thousand pigs and also with space for 50,000 pigs, raising over 100,000 pigs a year- a fattening farm. The enterprise was enormous, becoming one of the largest and most profitable meat and fat operations in the world. Later, he developed a theme that would be reiterated through the 20th century: biotechnology could provide solutions to societal crises, such as food and energy shortages. For Ereky, the term 'biotechnology' indicated the process by which raw materials could be biologically upgraded into socially useful products."

After receiving his doctorate, he continued his research at the Animal Breeding Research Station (ABRS), located in Roslin, a short distance from Edinburgh, Scotland. (The ABRS would be renamed the Roslin Institute in 1993.) .At the Roslin Institute, Wilmut worked with Keith Campbell. Together, they realized that in order to make an already differentiated cell behave like an embryonic cell, it would be necessary to cause the cell to become quiescent, or, in effect, to hibernate. They induced quiescence in differentiated embryonic cells and implanted them in the wombs of surrogate sheep. The result of this process was manifested in two sheep, Megan and Morag, born in July 1995. The next breakthrough for Wilmut and his team came in July 1996 with the birth of Dolly. Named after country singer Dolly Parton, the cloned Finn Dorset sheep was produced from the combination of an ovum and an adult mammary cell’s quiescent nucleus. The mammary cells, harvested from the udder of an ewe, had been made to hibernate through starvation, which caused near-immobility in the differentiated nucleus. The quiescent nuclei could then be injected into denucleated sheep ova and implanted into a surrogate mother. Here, the nucleus would resume activity and the cell would behave like a regular embryonic cell. Dolly’s birth and, more importantly, the methods by which she was created, drew much attention to Wilmut and his team, both in the scientific community and in popular culture. He has received many honors, including the Order of the British Empire in 1999, induction into the Royal Society in 2002, the Paul Ehrlich Prize in 2005, and the prestigious Shaw Prize in 2008. He was knighted in 2008. Sir Ian Wilmut, the man who led the team that created Dolly the sheep, the first mammal to be cloned from an adult cell, has died, aged 79."

Yuan Longping was born in Beijing in 1930 and received his agronomic degree from Southwest Agricultural College (now Southwest University) in 1953. Subsequently, he began his teaching career at Anjiang Agricultural School in Hunan Province, China.  Mr. Yuan’s work on hybrid rice started in the 1960 with the backdrop of an unprecedented famine. He reported findings on mutated male-sterile rice plants in the Chinese Science Bulletin in 1966. As these experiments did not show significant advantage over common rice, he started cross breeding with a wild rice species, known as ‘wild abortive’.Subsequent experiments, involving a large team of scientists and farmers across the country, proved successful as the new hybrid rice performed better than conventional rice. By 1979, this technique for hybrid rice was being introduced in the United States. Mr. Yuan’s rice accomplishments continued over the years.The late 1990s saw the launch of the Super Hybrid Rice Breeding Research Programme, under Mr. Yuan’s guidance, aiming to carry out national demonstration and promotion of the research results of super rice. In the next decade, China doubled rice production while reducing use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides.Yuan Longping’s hybrid rice varieties eventually became dominant in China’s paddies and in overall rice production. And China has dominated world hybrid rice production since 2004.Mr Yuan Longping was credited with a long list of awards and prizes, including China’s first special invention award in 1981, the UNESCO Prize for Science in 1987, the Nikkei Asia Award in 1996, the State Preeminent Science and Technology Award in 2000, the Wolf Prize in Agriculture and the Word Food Prize in 2004.Mr Yuan Longping passed away on 22 May 2021 at the age of 91, in Changsha, Hunan Province, China."

Dr. Mullis later joined the Cetus Corporation in Emeryville, California, where he worked as a DNA chemist . He contributed his seven years out there conducting research on oligonucleotide synthesis and inventing the polymerase chain reaction.In 1986, he was named director of molecular biology at Xytronyx, Inc. in San Diego, where he worked in DNA technology and Photochemistry. In 1987 began consulting on nucleic acid chemistry for more than a dozen corporations, including Angenics, Cytometrics, Eastman Kodak, Abbott Labs, Milligen/Biosearch, and Specialty Laboratories.Dr. Mullis served on the board of scientific advisors of several companies, provided expert advice in legal matters involving DNA, and was a frequent lecturer at college campuses, corporations and academic meetings around the world.The process, which Dr. Mullis conceptualized in 1983, is hailed as one of the monumental scientific techniques of the twentieth century. A method of amplifying DNA, PCR multiplies a single, microscopic strand of the genetic material billions of times within hours. The process has multiple applications in medicine, genetics, biotechnology, and forensics. PCR, because of its ability to extract DNA from fossils, is in reality the basis of a new scientific discipline, paleobiology.Dr. Mullis has authored several major patents. His patented inventions include the PCR technology and UV-sensitive plastic that changes color in response to light. His most recent patent application covers a revolutionary approach to instantly mobilize the immune system to neutralize invading pathogens and toxins, leading to the formation of his latest venture, Altermune Technologies, of which he is the Chief Scientific Advisor.His many publications include “The Cosmological Significance of Time Reversal” (Nature), “The Unusual Origin of the Polymerase Chain Reaction” (Scientific American), “Primer-directed Enzymatic Amplification of DNA with a Thermostable DNA Polymerase” (Science), and “Specific Synthesis of DNA In Vitro via a Polymerase Catalyzed Chain Reaction” (Methods in Enzymology).Dr. Mullis has written an autobiographical book titled Dancing Naked in the Mind Field published by Pantheon Books in 1998.Mullis received a Nobel Prize in chemistry in 1993, for his invention of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR).

Haberlandt first pointed out the possibilities of the culture of isolated tissues, plant tissue culture.He suggested that the potentialities of individual cells via tissue culture and also suggested that the reciprocal influences of tissues on one another could be determined by this method. Since Haberlandt's original assertions methods for tissue and cell culture have been realized, leading to significant discoveries in Biology and Medicine. His original idea presented in 1902 was called totipotentiality: “Theoretically all plant cells are able to give rise to a complete plant.The more efficient C-4 photosynthesis in land plants depends on a specialized Kranz (German for wreath) leaf anatomy was  first described by Gottlieb Haberlandt in 1904.He taught  botany at the Technical Academy in Graz. In 1910 Haberlandt succeeded Schwendener in the chair of plant physiology at the University of Berlin, where he established the Institute for Plant Study.He wrote a book Physiologische Pflanzenanatomie (1884; “Physiological Plant Anatomy”) in which he distinguished 12 tissue systems based on function (mechanical, absorptive, photosynthetic, etc.).

He developed an interest in science from his physician father and his older brother, with whom he enjoyed the outdoors. In 1939, he graduated in biochemistry from St John's College, Cambridge. A conscientious objector, he stayed on at the University of Cambridge during the Second World War to study the nutritional benefit of lysine in potatoes under biochemist Albert Neuberger.Sanger worked on  determining insulin's amino acid sequence, which had never been done before. Using chemistry and chromatography, and by mixing standard techniques with novel ones, he developed a method to read the amino acid sequence of insulin and found that this protein is actually made up of two amino acid chains linked together by disulphide bonds.He was the first person to obtain a protein sequence.By doing so, Sanger proved that proteins were ordered molecules and by analogy, the genes and DNA that make these proteins should have an order or sequence as well.In 1962  he joined the Medical Research Council (MRC) and worked with researchers, such as Francis Crick, who were studying DNA. Crick's enthusiasm for the subject was mesmerizing and soon Sanger had left the study of proteins for the challenge of sequencing DNA. Once again, Sanger combined the old with the new and developed an original DNA sequencing method, now known as the Sanger Method. In 1977, he and his colleagues published the sequence of a virus genome of over 5,000 base pairs.Sanger won his first Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1958 for his work on the structure of protein.In 1980, Sanger was awarded his second Nobel Prize in chemistry for his contributions to the study of DNA."

Franklin published 19 articles on coals and carbon, a few prominent being on 'thermal expansion of coals and carbonized coals', 'study of 5 structure of carbonaceous solids by measurements of true and apparent densities: part one - coals', 5 on DNA and 21 on viruses. She received many invitations to speak at various conferences all over the world upon her research work on viruses, which also awarded her several awards and enabled her garner professional recognition."

    "description": "Daisy Roulland-Dussoix (9 September 1936 at  Geneva, Switzerland – 5 January 2014 at  Lancy, Switzerland) was a Swiss molecular microbiologist. During her undergraduate education, she worked as a researcher on restriction enzymes. Daisy Roulland-Dussoix was born on September 9, 1936 in Geneva, Switzerland. His parents were Edmond Louis Dusoit and Elsa Magatha (Sauerbrey) Dusoit. Daisy Roulland-Dussoix (née Daisy Dussoix) received her first degree in chemistry and biology at the University of Geneva (1958), followed by her doctorate in biophysics (1964). While a graduate student at the University of Geneva, she discovered restriction enzymes, bacterial enzymes that attach to DNA. This discovery led to the advancement of molecular biology, opening the door to genome editing and cloning technology. His lawyer, Werner Arber, won the Nobel Prize in 1978 for this discovery. Later in her career, Daisy transferred to UCSF, where she worked on proto-oncogenes with Harold Varmus, who won the Nobel Prize in 1989. In 1980 Daisy moved to Paris and became director of the Mycoplasma Laboratory at the Pasteur Institute. She failed in January 2014. While working on his PhD with Swiss microbial geneticists Werner Arber and Eduard Kellenberger, he first demonstrated that immunity from bacteria (bacteriophages) led to the discovery that restriction and treatment of enzymes were important. Molecular Biology Tools. These enzymes affect the cleavage of DNA from specific sequences by enzymes at specific points, unless the enzymes are protected by enzymatic modification through the DNA base. This system prevents the spread of bacterial infections. Grete Kellenberger-Gujer's previous research showed that phage DNA can be degraded by the host's bacterial cells. Daisy Dussoix and Werner Arber showed in two publications that this process requires enzymes, paving the way for the discovery and isolation of relevant restriction and repair enzymes. They first presented these results at the First International Congress on Biophysics in Stockholm in 1961. In 1964, supported by a postdoctoral fellowship from Jane Pall Childs, Dussoit moved to Stanford University in the United States to work with Robert Lehman. From 1968 he was an assistant professor in the Department of Microbiology at the University of California, San Francisco, where he continued to work on DNA restriction and repair with Herbert W Boyer."

    "description": "Françoise Barré-Sinoussi is a French virologist and Director of the Regulation of Retroviral Infections Division and Professor at the Institut Pasteur in Paris, France who was born on 30 July 1947, Paris, France. from a very young age, she was very interested in science. After realizing that she was very talented in the sciences compared to her humanities courses, She expressed her interest to her parents that she would like to attend university to study science or become a researcher. She was more interested in becoming a doctor but at the time she was under the false impression that studying medicine was both more expensive and lengthier than a career in science. After two years studying at the university, she tried to find part-time work in a laboratory to ensure that she had made the right career choice. After searching for laboratory work for a year, she was finally appointed at the Pasteur Institute. Her part-time work at the Pasteur Institute quickly became full-time. She was attending university only to take the exams and had to rely on her friends’ class notes because she was not regularly attending class. However shei was actually scoring higher on her exams than before because she finally had the motivation because she had realized a career in science was what she wanted. In 1974,  She received her PhD, and interned in the U.S. National Institutes of Health before returning to the Pasteur Institute in Montagnier's unit. During the early AIDS epidemic in 1981 to 1984, while Working with Luc Montagnier, Jean-Claude Chermann and others at the institute, from a biopsied swollen lymph node of a patient at risk for AIDS, she isolated and grew a retrovirus later known as HIV-1. This discovery helped in the development of diagnostic tests to aid and  to control the spread of the virus, for informing policy on the treatment of people living with AIDS, and for many important advancements in the science of HIV/AIDS that ultimately saved countless lives. In 1988, she started her own laboratory at the Pasteur Institute."

When he returned from the war, he continued to take classes and was admitted into the University of Jena medical faculty. He passed his medical examination in 1877 and became a licensed doctor.Roux made several substantial contributions to the field of experimental embryology. In 1881 he used Charles Darwin’s theory of natural selection to describe the relationships between cells and the development of organs in embryos, and published these ideas in Der Kampf der Theile im Organismus.Few years later, in 1883, Roux discussed another theory that would later develop into the Roux-Weismann theory of mosaic development in his paper “Über die Bedeutung der Kerntheilungsfiguren.”Roux also conducted many influential experiments on the early development of the embryo.From  series of experiments with green frog blastomeres at the 2- and 4-cell stages of development,He concluded from these experiments that blastomeres at the earliest stages of development already have a predetermined fate, meaning they develop mosaically.He founded the first journal of experimental embryology, called Archiv für Entwicklungsmechanik der Organismen.Roux died on 15 September 1924 in Halle, Germany."

The idea of temporary hormonal contraception in the female body entered his mind in February 1919, when he was already Professor of Physiology in Innsbruck. He pursued his project ambitiously and by 1921 demonstrated temporary hormonal contraception in a female animal by transplanting ovaries from a second, pregnant, animal. From 1923, after further successful scientific work in this field, he began highlighting the importance of clinical trials in presentations. From then, he was criticized by his colleagues, who accused him of hindering unborn life. His idea was contradictory to the moral, ethic, religious and political agendas of that time in Europe. In 1927 official reports escalated, his family was ostracized by the local population, and Ludwig Haberlandt refused any further interviews. Against all opposition, in 1930 he began clinical trials after successful production of a hormonal preparation, Infecundin, by the G. Richter Company in Budapest, Hungary. Although at the peak of his scientific career, he was unable to pursue other scientific agendas because of the disputed contraception project.After he committed suicide, on 22 July 1932, scientific discussion about hormonal contraception ceased until 1970 when scientists began referring to his earlier medical and scientific work."
